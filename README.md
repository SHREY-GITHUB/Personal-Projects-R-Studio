# Personal-Projects-R-Studio
I am going to upload various personal projects that will be compiled in R Studio. The topics will be related to Machine Learning and Data Science.

1) CARDEKHO1 is a linear regression program where I have performed various Linear Regression such as OLS Regression, Subset regression, Forward and Backward Subset Regression, Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression.
The Car Data has been taken fro cardekho.com which is also available on Kaggle.com.
