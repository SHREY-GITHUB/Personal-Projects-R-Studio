# Personal-Projects-R-Studio
I am going to upload various personal projects that will be compiled in R Studio. The topics will be related to Machine Learning and Data Science.

1) CARDEKHO1 is a linear regression program where I have performed various Linear Regression such as OLS Regression, Subset regression, Forward and Backward Subset Regression, Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression.
The Car Data has been taken fro cardekho.com which is also available on Kaggle.com.
Here I am predicting the value of Selling Price of second hand car by regressing various independent variables such as Ex-Showrrom Price, Type of Dealership, Date of Purchase, Type of Transmission, etc.

2) AdmissionPredict is a classification program where datasets containing GRE Score, CGPA, etc. parameters are given and based on that we need to classify whether a student will get admission into a college or not.
The dataset was taken from Kaggle.com
